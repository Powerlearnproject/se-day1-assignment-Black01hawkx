# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It'S the systemic application of engineering principals, method, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Security- intergration of security measures into softwares has improved cyber security
building of softwares applications that have improved communication systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Development of programming languages,eg. Fortran C
Software engineering establishment,in 1960s
Introduction of structured programming, in 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Reqirements-Gathering and documentation of user demands
Testing-Conducting tests to ensure the functionality $ quality standard of the s0ftware
Deployment-launching a software to your client/customer

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is sequantial and a moe distinct phase eg. a financial system software has strict security compliance while Agile is iterative and incremental focused on flexibility,collaboration and response to changes eg. mobile and social media apps are tested and readjusted depending on the users feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- incharge of writing code
Quality Assurance Engineer-Incharge of ensuring quality design of the project software together with arranging tests plans
Project Manager-Incharge of planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-It provides a textual editing platform for writing code, debugging and testing eg Visual Studio(VScode)
Version Control Systems (VCS)-Tools responsible for tracking changes to the source code and coordinates work among team members, eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadlines-Orginization and proper documentation incooperated with team work.
Changing requirements-Flexibility and effective communication between the client , developer and lias team

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit- testing individual software components
Intergration- testing interactions within different subsystems
System- testing the software as whole
Acceptance- testing the software's capability against the user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

it refers to drafting questions and statements that trigger the best response from vast AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

As an african student in kenya, enrolled into a software engineering program.Please outline a brief list of the common challenges he/she might face.Give an appropriate idea of a project that he/she can come up with to counteract the challenges.

The prompt dives deeper into the context enhancing a better understanding of the AI model to generate a more focused answer.
